I am a researcher at the University of Tokyo advised by [Shixiang Shane Gu](https://sites.google.com/view/gugurus/home).
Previously, I was at the [UW Allen School](https://www.cs.washington.edu/) working with the [UW Reality Lab](https://realitylab.uw.edu/).

My research interests revolve around perceptive AI capable of making sense of multimodal input to make decisions grounded in the real world through interactions.
