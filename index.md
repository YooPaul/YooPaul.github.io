I am a researcher at the University of Tokyo advised by [Shixiang Shane Gu](https://sites.google.com/view/gugurus/home) and [Yutaka Matsuo](http://ymatsuo.com/index.html).
Previously, I was at the [UW Allen School](https://www.cs.washington.edu/) working with the [UW Reality Lab](https://realitylab.uw.edu/).

My research interests span probablistic 3D visual perception, including but not limited to 3D scene understanding, reconstruction, inverse graphics, and spatio-temporal capture and synthesis. I am mainly interested in inferring the 3D world from 2D observations with applications in robotics and AR/VR.
